# ROAM
R Open Abstraction Module

- a collection of functions for repeatable, transferable literate analysis
- functions should enable re-use of code-snippets for common analysis tasks independent of data-source or subject field
- functions should do one thing only (DOTO), easy to implement, be chainable, and reused often
